## üÖ∞Ô∏è About:
```
A simple obfuscation tool designed to obfuscate executables and scripts or to confuse patterns in executables.
This project serves as an example of a custom obfuscator that uses various custom techniques.
The project will be developed and include new features and design changes.
```

## üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Features:
- **Non-destructive Obfuscation**: Ensures that the file remains fully functional after the obfuscation process, preserving its original behavior and integrity.
- **Script Support**: Capable of obfuscating various script types including .bat and .vbs files, in addition to standard executable files.
- **Core Obfuscation Methods**:
  - **ControlFlow**: Alters the logical flow of execution within the code to make it more difficult to understand and analyze.
  - **JunkMethods**: Inserts meaningless methods and code segments that do not affect the program‚Äôs functionality but make the codebase more complex and harder to decipher.
  - **ProxyString**: Hides string literals by using proxy objects, complicating the process of identifying and extracting string data.
  - **HideOEP**: Conceals the Original Entry Point (OEP) of the executable.
  - **RenameFunctions**: Renames functions and methods to obscure their purpose and increase the difficulty of code analysis.
- **Auxiliary Features**:
  - **AntiDe4Dot**: Provides protection against De4Dot, a tool commonly used to deobfuscate .NET assemblies.
  - **Watermark**: feature to indicate that a file has been obfuscated using a necro-obfuscator :D.
